## My process

Starting from https://www.ducatodipiazzapontida.it/cultura-tradizioni-folclore/vocabolario-italiano-bergamasco/ I decided to build a vocabulary app from which you can search italian words and get the translation in bergamasco.
The process of getting all the words and their meaning from the original website was done through web scraping into a JSON file.
After having all data in data.json file I started to build the webpage with HTML and design it with CSS.
The logic part of the project was done with JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- axios

### What I learned

In the process of building the webpage I learned to get the data from websites through web scraping, I also improved my knowledge working with axios, objects and JSON files.
